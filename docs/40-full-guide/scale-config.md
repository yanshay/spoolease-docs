For configuration, SpoolEase Scale offers a web application similar to SpoolEase Console.

## SpoolEase Scale Web Configuration

SpoolEase Scale has no display so the security key isn't visible on the device, so you'll need to remember it. For convenience, you can use the same fixed key you configured for SpoolEase Console, which is displayed when web configuration is activated on that device.

If you forget your security key, follow the reset procedure described in the [SpoolEase Scale Setup](../build-setup/scale-setup) troubleshooting section.

Most configuration steps were completed during initial setup and won't be repeated here.

## Enabling SpoolEase Scale

By default, SpoolEase Console does not assume SpoolEase Scale is present in the system.

To enable it:
1. Access the web configuration of SpoolEase Console (not SpoolEase Scale web configuration)
2. You can enable it without additional information, allowing the system to automatically discover any SpoolEase Scale on the network
3. Alternatively, you can configure it to search for SpoolEase Scale at a specific IP address (useful if you've set a fixed IP) or to connect only to a specifically named SpoolEase Scale (configured during setup)

## Recalibrating the Scale

If you notice inaccurate measurements, you can recalibrate the scale at any time by following the procedure in the [SpoolEase Scale Setup Guide](../build-setup/scale-setup).

## Finding SpoolEase Scale IP Address

If you need to know the IP address of SpoolEase Scale, even when SpoolEase Console is not connected to it, use the "Scale(s) Information" button in the Settings screen.

## Updating SpoolEase Scale Firmware

You can update SpoolEase Scale firmware through:
1. The initial installation web page you used during setup, or
2. Over the network via the web configuration interface

For network updates, use the web configuration to view the latest version and initiate the update process. To monitor progress, press the button in the network update section periodically, which will show the updated progress. The device will automatically reboot once the update is complete.
