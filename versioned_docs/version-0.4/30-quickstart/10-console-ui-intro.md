# Intro to SpoolEase Console UI

SpoolEase's main user interface consists of three vertically stacked screens, with only one visible at a time. 
You can navigate between them by swiping up or down on the display. 
In some cases, such as during an OTA update, navigation may be temporarily disabled.

### Screens (from top to bottom):
- **Terminal** – Displays logs  
- **Main Spools View** – The primary interface for managing spools  
- **Settings** – Configuration options  
  The Settings screen has two tabs. Switch between them using the buttons labeled 1 and 2 on the left.

When turned on, the device starts on the terminal screen. Once the boot process completes successfully, it automatically switches to the main spools view.

### Multi Printer Selection
If you use a multi-printer setup, you can swipe left to expose a screen on the right for selecting the printer to view.
