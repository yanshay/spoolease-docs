## Operations in the Settings Screen

The **Settings Screen** allows you to manage and configure SpoolEase. Below are the available options and their functions:

### Enable/Disable Web Config
This option enables or disables the web-based configuration interface for SpoolEase. When enabled, you can access the configuration page from a browser by following the instructions that will appear on the screen. Disabling it ensures that no further modifications can be made remotely until re-enabled.

### Reset WiFi Credentials and Restart
Selecting this option will erase the stored WiFi credentials and restart the device. After restarting, SpoolEase will enter WiFi setup mode, allowing you to connect it to a new network. This is useful if you need to switch networks or troubleshoot connectivity issues.

### Restart Device
This option simply reboots SpoolEase. It is helpful when applying new settings or troubleshooting minor issues without powering the device off manually.

### Update Firmware Over Network (OTA Update)
This feature allows SpoolEase to download and install the latest firmware updates directly over the network. When selected, the device will check for updates, download them if available, and proceed with the installation. During this process, the device may become temporarily unresponsive. After the update is complete, SpoolEase will automatically restart with the latest firmware.

> **Note:** During an OTA update, navigation between screens will be disabled until the process is complete.
