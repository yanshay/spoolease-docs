Until documentation is detailed, just scan a Bambu Lab Tag and follow the instructions in the user interface.

Note that Bambu Lab spools have two NFC tags, which SpoolEase currently treats as separate spools. Use only one tag and always scan the same one.

Choose a consistent scanning orientation (e.g. the AMS loading orientation) and use it for all Bambu Lab spools.
