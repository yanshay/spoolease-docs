# Welcome to SpoolEase 0.5

We’re excited to have you join the growing community of happy SpoolEase users!  

## What is SpoolEase ?

SpoolEase is a smart add-on system for Bambu Lab 3D printers that adds intelligence and control to every filament spool.

It features:
- NFC tags for automatic spool identification
- A complete **spool inventory management system** - keeping your spools organized
- **Precise filament weight tracking** using (1) weight scale, (2) print usage monitoring, and (3) a smart workflow - so you can tell how much filament is available in every spool
- **Automatic slot configuration** for material, color, pressure advance (K)
- A **Virtual Spool Tag** for viewing spool info on your mobile device
- Compatibility with your slicer filament settings
- Even serves as **backup for your pressure advance settings** (for when the printer loses them — and yes, it happens)
- More ...

The system includes two products:  
- **SpoolEase Console** – The main hub with display, handling NFC tag encoding, inventory tracking, printer setup, and AMS filament status. SpoolEase Console works independently and does not require SpoolEase Scale.  
- **SpoolEase Scale** – Measures spool weight and feeds data to the Console. SpoolEase Scale depends on SpoolEase Console to operate.

And most importantly, even though it’s an open-source project, it’s fun and easy to build and surprisingly simple to set up!
