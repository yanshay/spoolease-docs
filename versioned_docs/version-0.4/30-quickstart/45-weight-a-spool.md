# Weight a Spool 

When weighting a spool you can see both the total weight of the spool and, if core information available, the weight of filament left on the spool.

The standard scanning procedure will read whatever information is encoded in the NFC tag.

If you then place the scanned spool on the scale:

- If core information is available, both the total weight and net filament weight will display in the center of the screen as described earlier.
- If not, then only total weight will be displayed
