# Usage Troubleshooting

#### Connectivity Issues
- Keep Console and Scale at a distance to avoid interference, which may lead to:
  - Repeated disconnections of the Scale from the Console
  - Connectivity problems between the Console and the Printer, causing slow responses
  - Other related issues


#### Unreliable encoding
- Use a high-quality, stable and strong enough USB power adapter.
- Try a different USB cable.
- Don’t place the tag directly on the PN532 — keep it about 1 cm away for reliable encoding.
- Ensure you’re using a compatible tag: NTAG215 only. While Mifare is supported for normal use, it's currently not supported for Encoding the virtual label. FeliCa tags are not supported at all.
