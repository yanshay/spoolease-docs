# Software Updates

Software updates are available from the Settings screen. Swipe up when on the main screen to open it and tap Update Firmware Over Network.

You can update both the Scale and the Console. If updates are available for both, update the Scale first, let it finish, then update the Console.

There are two main release channels: stable and beta. A third, debug channel with the latest but potentially risky versions is available on request, with instructions provided via Discord.

Updates are also possible through Web Config, but only stable versions are offered there.
