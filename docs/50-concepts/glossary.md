# Glossary

**Web Config**  
The browser-based configuration interface used to set up and manage SpoolEase remotely from a computer or mobile device.

**Console**  
The primary local interface shown on the device’s display, used for scanning tags, viewing spool information, and performing common operations.

**Terminal Screen**  
A screen within the Console that displays textual initialization progress and important system events the user should be aware of.

**Settings Screen**  
The configuration screen accessible from the Console, used to adjust device settings such as network configuration, firmware updates, scale calibration, and more.

**Security Key / Fixed Security Key**  
A unique code required to access protected features like inventory and configuration through Web Config. The fixed security key can be randomly generated per session or manually set to a permanent value.

**Inventory**  
The central database of all spools stored on the SD card, along with the application that manages it. It contains details such as weights, filament type, K-values, tag links, and more.

**Spool Record**  
An entry in the inventory representing a single physical spool, including its properties, tracking data, and tag association.

**Slot**  
A virtual location representing either an AMS slot or another position where a spool can be placed. Each slot can be associated with a spool to track its status.

**External**  
A special slot representing external spool usage, typically for spools not loaded into the AMS but still tracked by SpoolEase.

**Staging**  
A temporary state for scanned tags before assigning them to operations such as linking, encoding, or loading. It serves as a hub for spool-related actions.

**Tag**  
An NFC tag attached to a spool, used to identify the spool by scanning. Each tag can be linked to exactly one spool record in the inventory.

**Tag Emulation**  
A feature where the device emulates an NFC tag, allowing a mobile phone to scan it and quickly open a specific application.

**Tag Encoding**  
The process of writing spool information onto an NFC tag so that scanning it with a mobile device opens the spool’s information in a browser.
