# Viewing Spool Tag Information  

If you want to view filament information directly from the spool, you can **encode the filament data on the NFC tag** by scanning the spool to staging, then selecting **Staging → More... → Encode Tag**, and placing the tag next to the NFC reader.  

After this, whenever you scan the tag with your mobile phone, it will open your mobile browser to display the spool information.  
Make sure **NFC is enabled** (on Android, it may be disabled by default).
