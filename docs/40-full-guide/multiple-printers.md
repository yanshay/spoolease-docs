# Multiple Printers

SpoolEase can work with multiple printers at once. Configure them in Web Config.

It connects to all of them simultaneously but shows only one on the screen. To switch printers, swipe left on the main screen to open the printer list, then tap the one you want. Also, certain operations may automatically switch the displayed printer.

Because memory and CPU are limited, there’s a cap on active printers:
	•	Memory allows up to 3 active printers. You can configure more, but only 3 should be active.
	•	CPU load depends on the model: P1S/A1 are light, X1 is heavier, and H2 is the most demanding.

For some features, the Console offloads work to the Scale when resources are tight. If no Scale is present, certain functions (like tracking filament consumption when printing) won’t work correctly.
