### Web Config Instructions
This will display a page with instructions on how to access the Consoleâ€™s web configuration.  
There are two ways to access it:  
- **Scan SpoolEase NFC reader** with your mobile phone. This will open your mobile browser and automatically fill in the security key.  
- **Manually enter the URL** displayed on the screen and use the security key as displayed there as well.
- Manually enter the url as shown on the screen.

### Reset WiFi Credentials and Restart
Selecting this option will erase the stored WiFi credentials and restart the device. After restarting, SpoolEase will enter WiFi setup mode, allowing you to connect it to a new network. This is useful if you need to switch networks or troubleshoot connectivity issues.

### Restart Device
This option simply reboots SpoolEase. It is helpful when applying new settings or troubleshooting minor issues without powering the device off manually.

### Update Firmware Over Network (OTA Update)
This feature allows SpoolEase to download and install the latest firmware updates directly over the network. When selected, the device will check for updates, download them if available, and proceed with the installation. During this process, the device may become temporarily unresponsive. After the update is complete, SpoolEase will automatically restart with the latest firmware.

> **Note:** During an OTA update, navigation between screens will be disabled until the process is complete.
