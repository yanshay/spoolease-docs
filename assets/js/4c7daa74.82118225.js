The main con of this method is that it's an extra step. Therefore SpoolEase tries to make it as easy as possible.\nMeasuring the weight is done when the spool information is loaded in the staging area. Then, pleacing the spool on the scale and pressing it's button takes the measurement. To simplify this even further, when a spool is taken out of the AMS, its information is automatically loaded into the staging area. That's also a great point in time to measure weight, so you know what's the accurate weight when you want to use this spool next time. So a weight workflow ends up being taking a spool after print is done from AMS, placing it on the scale and pressing the scale's button once the weight has stabilized.\nThe weight information is immediately updated in the inventory."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"weight-calculation-while-printing",children:"Weight Calculation While Printing"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"While weighting using the scale is accurate and easy it is impossible to perform when the spool is being used and inside AMS. Many times spools stay in the AMS for many prints and it's important to track the updated weight.\nFor this purpose, SpoolEase monitors the print and as the print progress, layer by layer, color by color, it calculates the consumed weight and decreases the spool weight automatically. Note that this is an estimate (though a pretty good one) as it relies on filament density variable as specified in the filament settings. This can differ betweeon one filament to antoher and practically no one updates it. But filaments of certain type are close enough for this approach to be accurate enough for practical use.\nCon of relying purely on this method is that when filament break, stuck in AMS, being cut for whatever reason, it does not consider that. Also, certain printing operations (such as the calibrations performed by the printer before prints) are not reported and not counted in.\nThe benefit of this approach is that you can monitor how much filament is left as it is being consumed by the printer, both in the inventory as well as in the spool information by simply pressing the slot in the console."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"spool-weight-glossary",children:"Spool Weight Glossary"}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Label Weight"}),(0,o.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","The weight printed on the spool's label, typically indicating the nominal filament weight without including the spool itself."]}),"\n",(0,o.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,o.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"Empty Weight"}),(0,o.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","The weight of the spool alone, without any filament.
