# Weight a Spool 

When weighting a spool you can see both the total weight of the spool and, if core information available, the weight of filament left on the spool.

When you scan the tag, spool information will load into staging.
The information will also be loaded to staging also when you take a spool out of the AMS.

If you then place that spool on the scale:

- If core information is available, both the total weight and net filament weight will display in the center of the screen as described earlier.
- If not, then only total weight will be displayed
