# Scan & Load Tagged Spools

### Loading a Spool into AMS

Loading a spool into AMS is a hands-free process. Here's how to do it:

1. **Scan the Tag**  
   - Place the spool tag next to SpoolEase.
   - The information will be automatically loaded into the **‘Staging’** box located at the bottom left of the display as **'Scanned'**.

2. **Wait for Confirmation**  
   - The information will remain in the Staging box for one minute. During this time, place the spool into the AMS.

3. **Automatic Slot Configuration**  
   - Once the spool is placed in the slot, SpoolEase will automatically recognize it and configure the slot with the corresponding information. No further action is needed on the SpoolEase display.

### Loading an External Spool

To load an external spool:

1. **Scan the Tag**  
   - Start the process just like loading a spool into AMS: place the spool tag next to SpoolEase.

2. **Configure the External Spool**  
   - Press the **‘Staging’** box at the bottom left of the display. All available slots will flash.
   - Then select **External Spool**.

This method can also be used with AMS slots as well, which is helpful when loading multiple spools at once. After scanning and configuring the slots manually, you can load all the spools together without waiting. It can also be useful if your tag is not attached to the spool and you forget to scan before you load and can configure later.
