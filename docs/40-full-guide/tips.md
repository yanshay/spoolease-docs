## Additional Usage Tips

- You may find it convenient to use the “Synchronize Filament List from AMS” feature in the slicer after loading tagged spools into the AMS, rather than manually selecting them in the slicer.

- To copy a spool’s tag, scan the source tag to move its data into staging, then encode the staging data onto the new tag.
