To access the Console Web Config:
To access the Console Web Config, open your browser and go to one of the following:  
- `http://<console-device-ip>/config`  
- `http://<console-device-name.local>/config` (requires mdns supporting client and network)

⚠️ Note: Use http, and not https.

For detailed instructions, on the console:  
1. Swipe up to open the settings screen below the main view.  
2. Tap **Web Config Instructions**.  

When that screen appears, you can also scan the console’s NFC tag with your phone. It will automatically open the Web Config URL with the security key prefilled.
