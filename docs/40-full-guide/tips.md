## Additional Usage Tips

- NFC tags are attached to spools, but it’s also recommended to mark the spool ID ,right after adding it to your SpoolEase inventory application, directly on the spool using a marker, sticker, printed label, or a [special tag holder](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2050083). Ideally, do this even before opening the spool, while it’s still in its packaging.

- You may find it convenient to use the “Synchronize Filament List from AMS” feature in the slicer after loading tagged spools into the AMS, rather than manually selecting them in the slicer.
