# Spool Weight

## Spool Weight Glossary

**Label Weight**  
The weight printed on the spool's label, typically indicating the nominal filament weight without including the spool itself.

**Empty Weight**  
The weight of the spool alone, without any filament. Useful for calculating remaining filament.

**Full Weight**  
The total weight of the spool when it is full of filament, including the spool itself.

**Gross Weight**  
The current combined weight of the spool and filament, as measured on the scale.

**Used Weight**  
The amount of filament that has been used from the spool so far, either through printing or removed/broken/cut in any way.

**Net Weight**  
The weight of the filament alone, excluding the spool. Calculated as Gross Weight minus Empty Weight.

**Printed Since Added**  
The amount of filament used for printing since the spool was first added to the inventory, tracked via printer activity.

**Printed Since Weighted**  
The amount of filament used for printing since the last time the spool was weighed on the scale.

**Consumed Since Load (to AMS)**  
The amount of filament used since the spool was loaded into the AMS (Automatic Material System).
